# Remote Multiplayer Tennis

A two person multiplayer game like Wii Tennis. Each player has an opposing view of the court and the game uses the accelerometer/gyroscope on the device to move the tennis racket.

This is a demo for this project: https://github.com/BluBambu/RemoteSensorAccess. Using that project, players can use their phones as the virtual tennis rackets.
